# Rogue-Mx

_Rogue-Mx_ is a compiler from _Mx**_ to _RISC-V, 32-bit, integer Extended_,
the project for _Compiler Design and Implementation_ at SJTU.
It's implemented mainly in _Kotlin/JVM_,
with the exception that the lexer and parser part contains _Java_,
since _antlr 4_ is used.

The language reference for _Mx**_ may be found in the
[project assignment](https://github.com/peterzheng98/Compiler-2020).

## Progress

Description|Status
---|---
ANTLR4|Completed
AST|Completed
Semantic|Completed, __pass__ given test suite
LLVM IR|Almost completed, __pass custom tests__, __pending given tests__
Optimize|Much to do, refer to _Optimize_ section
...|Not planned yet

## Known Issues

+ internal: built-in function does not override `toString()`

## Test Cases

Some scripts are in `test-tool` to automate testing.
They should be executed with _Z Shell_ in the project root folder.

Single-case custom test may fail if `\ ` in output,
no plan to fix this issue as it is rarely met.
Using the debugging mode can avoid this issue.

### Semantic Test

#### Given Test Suite

run with `assigned.sh semantic all` or `assigned.sh semantic <package> <number>`

Status|Notes
---|---

## How to build the compiler

To build this compiler, just execute
```shell script
sh gradlew installDist
```
or, on windows,
```shell script
gradlew.bat installDist
``` 
The result will be installed in `build/install/Rogue-Mx`.

_JDK 11_ are used for development. _JDK >= 1.8_ should be okay for build.

There is also another version in submodule _submit_,
which can be built offline with local resources in the judge docker.
To build it offline, just execute:
```shell script
sh gradlew installDist --offline
```

Library of built-in functions currently can only be generated by executing
```shell script
sh gradlew generateBuiltin
```
with
[riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain)
configured with:

```shell script
./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --with-arch=rv32ima --with-abi=ilp32
```

## Some notes

### Exit code info

Exit code|description
---|---
1|Nothing to execute or internal error
2|IO failure
3|Parser does not accept the code
4|AST builder does not accept the code
5|Semantic does not accept the code

### Discard of LLVM IR

The type system of LLVM IR is somehow annoying,
so it is deprecated.
A new IR is designed, which is also in CFG + SSA form,
just because SSA has already been implemented
when the decision is made.

It's also tried very hard to keep the compatibility to
output IR in LLVM IR form,
but it's not easy to add a fake type system,
and it's not worth it.

### Info about implementation

This part contains notes for future development.

#### `grammar.Variable`

+ only one `Variable` constructed for each declaration,
so unnecessary to override `equals()` and `hashCode()`
+ do not currently keep init info, access it using `Variable.def.init`

#### `semantic.SemanticMain`

+ maybe to `return` the `main` function in
`operator fun invoke(ASTNode.Program)` in the future,
as it is needed by llvm `Translator`

#### `ast.ASTNode` `ast.ASTType`

+ `ASTNode` cannot be separated due to the limitation of `sealed class`
+ `ASTType` is separated from `ASTNode`
to prevent an extremely large source file
